## What I Think About When I Think About Running

---

There is an ancient Chinese fable, “three in the morning and four in the evening,” by Zhuang Zi: 

A monkey trainer raised a great many monkeys. He loved them and knew their nature well. During a period when there was a food shortage, he wanted to curtail monkeys‘ share but feared their dissatisfaction and even rebellion. Thus, the monkey trainer came up with a way to delude them. “From now on, I’ll give you three chestnuts every morning and four every evening," he said. "Will that be enough?" All the monkeys rose with anger. “Then, what about four in the morning and three in the evening?" he proposed. After hearing that, the monkeys squatted down, happy and pliant again. 

Sometimes, there isn’t that much of a difference between us and the monkeys. Recently, I have been running for one hour every day. I discovered that we can fool our hearts by implementing a similar method as the monkey trainer did to the monkeys while running. Say you are running on a treadmill at ten kilometers per hour. As time passes, the signals of fatigue and the pain from the muscles and joints might gradually spread around the body. The thought of giving up and finding a decent excuse to call it a day starts to haunt our minds and become stronger and stronger. At this point, I increased the pace by 0.5 kilometers per hour temporarily. As my body got used to the new pace, I lowered the pace back to the original. I had the illusion that the pain and fatigue were also reduced, even though nothing changed essentially. 

Haruki Murakami once wrote, “Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional” in his book “What I Talk About When I Talk About Running.” I always prefer to suffer from breaking my limit, and applying the aforementioned “trick” significantly increased my endurance. In retrospect, such an attitude can also be used in many scenarios in life. We can “fool” ourselves or pretend to be “fooled” to disguise our hearts. Later, we might realize that we can do more than we expected.
