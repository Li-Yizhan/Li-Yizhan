### Construct ReLU Neural Network Which Efficiently Approximate Polynomials (Part 1)

In this and the following article, the goal is to construct **ReLU neural networks** which efficiently approximate polynomials and establish **approximation rates**, which quantify the size of the approximating neural networks relative to the approximation error. 

We start by recalling the definition of ReLU neural network. 

**Definition 2.1.** Let $ L \in \mathbb{N} $ and $ N_{0}, N_{1}, \ldots, N_{L} \in \mathbb{N} $ given by
