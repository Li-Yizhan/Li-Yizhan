## Harris Corner Detector

The Harris Corner Detector is a keypoint localization mathod used in computer vision to identify interest points or corners in an image. Developed by Chris Harris and Mike Stephens in 1988, the Harris Corner Detector is particularly useful for feature detection and matching, which are crucial tasks in various computer vision applications, such as object recognition, image stitching, and tracking.

If we consider an image as a 2-D matrix, with each element representing a pixel, then we can easily calculate the 1st and 2nd derivative of such matrix. Here is an illustrative picture showing how we can achieve this:
