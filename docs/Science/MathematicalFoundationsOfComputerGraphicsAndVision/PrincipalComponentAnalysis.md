## Principal Component Analysis

PCA is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction, which involves transforming data from a high-dimensional space into a lower-dimensioinal space while retraining as much variance (information) as possible. 

In other words, the goal of PCA is to find a mapping from inputs in a $d$ dimensional space to a new $k < d$ dimensional space with "minimum loss of information."
