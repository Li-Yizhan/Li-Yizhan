### Lyrics

Love will abide
Take things in stride
Sounds like good advice
But there's no one at my side

And time washes clean love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me
But I don't know what it means

'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long long time
